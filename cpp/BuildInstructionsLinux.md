# Building Ice for C++ on Linux

This file describes the Ice source distribution, including information about
compiler requirements, third-party dependencies, and instructions for building
and testing the distribution. If you prefer, you can install [binary
packages][1] for supported platforms that contain pre-compiled libraries,
executables, and everything else necessary to build Ice applications on Linux.

## C++ Build Requirements

### Operating Systems and Compilers

Ice is expected to build and run properly on any recent Linux distribution for
x86 and x86_64, and was extensively tested using the operating systems and
compiler versions listed for our [supported platforms][2].

### Third-Party Libraries

Ice has dependencies on a number of third-party libraries:

 - [Berkeley DB][6] 5.3
 - [bzip][5] 1.0
 - [expat][3] 2.1
 - [mcpp][7] 2.7.2 (with patches)
 - [OpenSSL][4] 0.9.8 or later

Expat, OpenSSL and bzip are included with most Linux distributions. ZeroC
supplies binary packages for Berkeley DB and mcpp on supported Linux
distributions that do not include them:

- Berkeley DB 5.3.28 on RHEL 6, SLES12, SLES 11 and Amzn 2015.03
- mcpp 2.7.2 with patches (`mcpp-devel`) on RHEL 7, RHEL 6, SLES 12, SLES 11
and Amzn 2015.03

## Building Ice

In a command window, change to the `cpp` subdirectory:

    $ cd cpp

Edit `config/Make.rules` to establish your build configuration. The comments in
the file provide more information. Pay particular attention to the variables
that define the locations of the third-party libraries.

Now you're ready to build Ice:

    $ make

This will build the Ice core libraries, services, and tests.

### 64-bit Source Builds on Linux x86_64

To build Ice in 64-bit mode, you need to do the following:

- Obtain or build all the third-party dependencies, and put the 64-bit libraries
in the lib64 directories. For example, put Berkeley DB 64-bit libraries in
`$DB_HOME/lib64`.
- Build and test as described above.

### 32-bit Source Builds on Linux x86_64

By default, builds on x86_64 are 64-bit. To perform a 32-bit build on an x86_64
Linux system, set the environment variable `LP64` to no, as shown below:

    $ export LP64=no

## Installing a C++ Source Build

Simply run `make install`. This will install Ice in the directory specified by
the `prefix` variable in `config/Make.rules`.

After installation, make sure that the `prefix/bin` directory is in your `PATH`.

If you choose to not embed a `runpath` into executables at build time (see your
build settings in `config/Make.rules`) or did not create a symbolic link from
the `runpath` directory to the installation directory, you also need to add the
library directory to your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

On an x86 system, the library directory is:

    prefix/lib                   (RHEL, SLES, Amazon)
    prefix/lib/i386-linux-gnu    (Ubuntu)

On an x86_64 system:

    prefix/lib64                 (RHEL, SLES, Amazon)
    prefix/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu  (Ubuntu)

When compiling Ice programs, you must pass the location of the `prefix/include`
directory to the compiler with the `-I` option, and the location of the library
directory with the `-L` option. If building a C++11 program, you must add the
`/c++11` suffix to the library directory (such as `prefix/lib/c++11`).

## Running the Test Suite

Python is required to run the test suite. Additionally, the Glacier2 tests
require the Python module `passlib`, which you can install with the command:

    $ pip install passlib

After a successful source build, you can run the tests as follows:

    $ make test

This command is equivalent to:

    $ python allTests.py

If everything worked out, you should see lots of `ok` messages. In case of a
failure, the tests abort with `failed`.
